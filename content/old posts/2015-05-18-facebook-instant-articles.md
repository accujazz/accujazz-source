О «моментальных статьях» Фейсбука уже успели написать столько умных текстов, что кажется, если сам Фейсбук первые итоги будет подводить еще не скоро, то медиа-сайты от этого запуска уже выиграли - за дискуссией такого уровня обязательно должны последовать реальные дела. Ниже рекомендуемые тексты по теме.

- [Introducing Instant Articles](http://media.fb.com/2015/05/12/instantarticles/)

> People share a lot of articles on Facebook, particularly on our mobile app. To date, however, these stories take an average of eight seconds to load, by far the slowest single content type on Facebook. Instant Articles makes the reading experience as much as ten times faster than standard mobile web articles.

> With wider adoption, Instant would effectively remove Facebook from the mobile referrer pool, and mobile web traffic would plummet—for adopters, totally; for everyone else, more than they might expect. If enough partners use Instant, and if there is enough good Instant content to read, users will begin to regard linked-out stories as weird slow garbage that should Not Be Clicked.

> If you need Facebook to solve the page load problem, then as media entity you need to be darwined.
