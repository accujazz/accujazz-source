__Hi__, my name is ![Profile photo](/img/profile-photo.jpg)Alexey Gornostaev. I help build video game-related software products. 

Over the past 10 years i was responsible for creating and developing a video games digital distribution service, mobile in-game social and support platform for [Game Insight](https://www.game-insight.com/en), [video games media](https://kanobu.ru/) with a monthly audience of more than 5 million people and co-founded a [video game discovery site](https://rawg.io/) (think the movie diary Letterboxd meets IMDb).

I am interested in the processes that help understand customers needs,  build the right things for them and skip unnecessary. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/accujazz), read the [blog](/posts) (mostly in Russian), [send me an email](mailto:me@alexey.is) or direct message via Twitter.
