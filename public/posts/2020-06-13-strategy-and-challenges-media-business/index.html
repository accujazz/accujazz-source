		<h1>Media companies should stop aiming for more reach</h1>
		<span class="date-published">June 13, 2020</span>
		<p>As usual a <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/never-ending-niches/">great essay</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson">@benthompson</a> on the big picture of strategy and challenges media business face on the internet.</p>
<p>It’s near impossible to be in the “More reach” quadrants nowadays. Ad rates are not sustainable for most publishers.</p>
<p>Publishers are forced look for new ways to monetize. And sooner or later they will realize that their current wider audience doesn’t convert into anything useful.</p>
<p>To reach these numbers they do anything possible to attract no matter who from Facebook, Google, etc. These people come and go. This is traffic, not an audience.</p>
<p>Nothing changes for you as a publisher between 5 or 8 million visitors per month. The money doesn’t grow proportionally. Which is a sign that something is wrong, no?</p>
<p>And in some sense current low ad rates reflect the value of that type of audience.</p>
<p>The only option left is to provide quality. Change KPIs - stop measuring only reach. Yes, the numbers will fall. But the value rise.</p>
<p>Highly concentrated niche audiences will always be valuable and desired to reach.</p>
