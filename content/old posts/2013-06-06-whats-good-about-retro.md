Музыкант [Брайн Ино](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%BE,_%D0%91%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B0%D0%BD) о привлекательности ретро. В точку.


> Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its 
> signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will 
> be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. It’s the sound of failure: so much modern art 
> is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The 
> distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues
>  singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases
>  it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing
>  events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.
