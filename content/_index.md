üëã __Hi__, my name is ![Profile photo](/img/profile-photo.jpg)Alexey Gornostaev. I'm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building video game-related software products. 

I work remotely and live in Moscow, Russia. I am interested in the processes that help understand customer needs,  build the right things for them and skip unnecessary.

You can [send me an email](mailto:me@alexey.is) or direct message me on [Twitter](ttps://twitter.com/#!/accujazz).

__Work__

- I consult on product development and strategy a [US-based startup](https://gather.gg) that is building a platform for creating tournaments and competitions for online video games.
- Co-founded a Lithuania-based [video game discovery site](https://rawg.io/) (think the movie diary Letterboxd meets IMDb). You can read a couple of essays from that time: [Video Game Markets Fail at Recommending Games](/posts/video-game-markets-fail-at-recommending-games/) and [You Have Nothing to Play](/posts/you-have-nothing-to-play/).
- Lead product at a Russian [video games media](https://kanobu.ru/) with a monthly audience of more than 5 million people.
- Worked on mobile in-game marketing and support platform for [Game Insight](https://www.game-insight.com/en).
- Was responsible for creating and developing a video games digital distribution service.

__Other projects__

I love to experiment and worked on a few personal projects over the years. Most of them are long offline but the experience remains:

- Online tool to create short compilations of your favorite songs. The tracks were auto cut in 11-seconds parts and mixed together with seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings with fades. The end result was sort of a bite-sized mixtape.
- Plain text file format praise: different ways to use plain text files.
- Chart of mobile apps most often mentioned in social media.
- Tool to view all replies to a single tweet back in the day when it was impossible to do so on Twitter.
- Video games price aggregator build when transition to digital was still in progress and video games were sold on all kinds of media.
