title: A round-up of the recent articles on where things are headed in video game space
---

If you'll ask me what recent shifts in the video game industry I view as the most interesting and aspiring i'll point you to these insightful observations made by other people:

- [Can virtual meeting spaces save us all from Zoom fatigue?](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/08/work-can-virtual-meeting-spaces-save-us-all-from-zoom-fatigue) Pandemic has changed a lot of our social and work-related perceptions and it isn't likely we'll move back to how things were prior. We are rethinking the work processes: hybrid and remote work are the new normal, video call is the default way of having a meeting, and corporations now onboard many employees virtually rather than on-site. The tools we've created in the last decade worked for the most part and made the shift to remote work and social life painless, but we are still in the beginning and a lot of startups will focus on rethinking tools for communication and collaboration. Video game like social spaces are starting to emerge and use the advantages of spatial interfaces and game mechanics to bring  virtual closer to real.

- [The Best Apps Today are 
Games in Disguise](https://www.jonlai.co/game-like). The best apps today use video game mechanics in their core product design. Fun is the new powermetric because users naturally gravitate to the most rewarding experience. When people have fun and feel they are achieving their goals, they build long-term habits. 

- [The Future of Games Is Instant](https://future.a16z.com/instant-games/) and [The Future of Games is an Instant Flash to the past](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/the-future-of-games-is-an-instant-flash-to-the-past/). Could instant games, i.e games that are frictionless, instantly playable no matter the device, accessible through links, and cross-platform be the future and what the embedded social aspect of the web and hyperlynking will change about how we develop and distribute games?

- [So You Want to Compete with Roblox](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/so-you-want-to-compete-with-roblox/). Roblox was numerous times mentioned during Apple/Epic trial and is one the most talked about companies in the industry. You also can't exclude the topic of Roblox when talking about platforms, distribution, platform fees and tools for creators. Each of which is in itself one of the most thinkabout topics in the industry right now.
