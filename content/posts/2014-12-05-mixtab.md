I would like to show a small new project of mine: online tool to create short compilations of your favourite songs.

Welcome to [MixTab](http://mixtab.io).

How it works. You can create a selection of your favourite music. You upload a bunch of tracks, MixTab processes the tracks, makes an 11-second cut from each and combines them in a single mix with fade-in/fade-out transitions between. The end result is a sort of a bite-sized mixtape. All the processing is made on your local machine, only the final mix is being uploaded to the server.

As a result you get a nice short sample of an artist or an album. And in short period of time decide if it is something worth paying more attention to or not.
Here is an [example to get the idea](http://mixtab.io/m/soR9UQETXQ). Here is another one of [Taylor Swift](http://mixtab.io/m/z9Ukg17OGQ).

Take it for a spin. I hope you'll like it.
