__Hello__,

My name is ![Profile photo](/img/profile-photo-small.jpg)Alexey Gornostaev and currently i work in video game space and help create media and recommendation products. 

I'am interested in technology, product management, inspiring new products and people behind them. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/accujazz), read at [Medium](https://medium.com/@accujazz) and here in the [posts archive](/posts) (in Russian) or direct message me via Twitter.

<!-- My first computer was a [Macintosh SE/30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE/30). I’am still a Mac user ✊. My love for video games started with [Prince of Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)) by Jordan Mechner which i first saw at my parents work. I was amazed and lost playing for hours. -->

I co-founded ![RAWG logo](/img/rawg.jpg)[RAWG](https://rawg.io") - a video game discovery site (that started as a simple [list of played video games](/vglibrary)!). Think the movie diary Letterboxd meets IMDb.

Previously i worked as a product manager at ![Kanobu Logo](/img/kanobu_logo.png)[Kanobu](https://kanobu.ru) (leading Russian gaming news media outlet), ![Game Insight Logo](/img/game-insight_logo.svg)[Game Insight](https://game-insight.com) (mobile games developer and publisher) and Rambler games (video games arm of the Russian web portal).

I worked on a few personal projects over the years: 

- __2014 - MixTab__. Online tool to create short compilations of your favourite songs. The tracks were auto cut in 11-seconds parts and mixed together with seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings with fades. The end result was sort of a bite-sized mixtape.
- __2012 - [Text and Glory](http://txtglory.com)__. A weekend project: plain text file format praise.
- __2012 - AppCatcher__. A chart of mobile apps most oftenly mentioned in social media by your friends and a selection of handpicked influencers.
- __2011 - Radarica__. Back in the day Twitter was very bad at displaying conversations. There was no way to view all replies to the original tweet, only the top-level ones were shown, but not the replies to replies. So i build a simple tool that did just that - displayed the whole conversation for a selected tweet in a simple one-page feed.
- __2009 - Igromatika__. A video games price aggregator build when transition to digital was still in progress and video games were sold on all kinds of media: boxed and jewel retails versions, collector's editions and digital versions in a bunch of different stores.
