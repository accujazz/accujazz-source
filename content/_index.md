I worked on a few personal projects over the years: 

- __2014 - MixTab__. Create short compilations of your favourite songs. What if there was a way to get an idea of that new hot album in just 1 minute? MixTab grabed the tracks you selected, took a random 11-seconds part from each and mixed the fragments into one track, putting fade-in/fade-out effects on the track cuts.
- __2012 - [Text and Glory](http://txtglory.com)__. Plain text file format praise. Plain text files can be opened in every text editor ever made and they are flexible enough to be used for taking notes, managing tasks and even creating basic html pages.
- __2012 - AppCatcher__. With AppCatcher you could see what apps your friends wrote about and latest apps that were reviewed and mentioned in a handpicked selection of popular blogs and websites.
- __2011 - Radarica__. A simple tool to track twitter conversations that matter. How it worked: you favorite a single tweet in a conversation, log in with your twitter account to Radarica and could view the whole conversations for recently favorited tweets.
- __2009 - Igromatika__. Igromatika helped it's users to choose where to buy PC and video games. It aggregated prices among a selection of stores selling digital and boxed versions of games. The goal was to let users find great games and guide them throw a variety of prices, platform and package options.
